      <subsection name="Build and Run">
        <p>
          You can build and install the module locally first in the project root folder.
        </p>
        <div>
          <source><![CDATA[
          $ mvn clean install
        ]]></source>
        </div>

        <p>
          And you can build and run the Demo project:
        </p>
        <div>
          <source><![CDATA[
          $ cd demo
          $ mvn clean verify && mvn -Pcargo.run
        ]]></source>
        </div>

        <p>For testing, visit <a href="http://localhost:8080/site/campaign1">http://localhost:8080/site/campaign1</a>.</p>

      <subsection name="Demo Page Flow Definition">
        <p>In the demo project, the Page Flow definition for the channel (<a href="http://localhost:8080/site/campaign1">http://localhost:8080/site/campaign1</a>) is defined in the following document:</p>
        <img src="images/demoflowdef1.png" alt="Demo Page Flow Definition 1" />

        <p>The above Page Flow Definition document defines all the page states, events and transitions in the document editor.</p>

        <p>It is actually represents the following Finite State Machine diagram:</p>
        <img src="images/demoflowfsm1.png" alt="Demo Finite State Machine 1" />

        <ul>
          <li>Visitor starts the journey by visiting the <strong>Landing Page</strong> page state.</li>
          <li>On "start.quote" event (usually an event is triggerd by a user's action in the step page), it would be transitioned to <strong>Plan Selection</strong> page state.</li>
          <li>On "family.plan.selected" event, it would be transitioned to <strong>Dependents Entry</strong> page state, which would be transitioned to <strong>Application Entry</strong> page state afterward. Or on "single.plan.selected" event, it would be transitioned to <strong>Application Entry</strong> page state directly.</li>
          <li>On "application.submitted" event, it would be transitioned to <strong>Review</strong> page state.</li>
          <li>On "application.reviewed" event, it would be transitioned to <strong>Payment</strong> page state.</li>
          <li>On "payment.accepted" event, it would be transitioned to <strong>Confirmation</strong> page state, which leads to <strong>Final End</strong> state. Or on "payment.rejected" event, it would stay in the <strong>Payment</strong> page state.</li>
          <li><strong>Application Entry</strong>, <strong>Review</strong> and <strong>Payment</strong> page states could be transitioned back to the <strong>Landing Page</strong> page state on "cancel.requested" event.</li>
        </ul>

      <subsection name="Example Page Flow Implementation in Demo Project">
        <p>The demo project includes multiple pages and <a href="https://github.com/bloomreach-forge/page-flow/tree/master/demo/site/src/main/java/org/onehippo/forge/pageflow/demo/campaign/components">HST Components</a> depending on the Page Flow Definition shown above. When you visit <a href="http://localhost:8080/site/campaign1">http://localhost:8080/site/campaign1</a>, you may start a Page Flow instance with the following first step:</p>

        <h4>1. Page State: Landing Page</h4>
        <p>In this page state, when you click on "Start!" button, it posts the form to the HstComponent's <code>#doAction()</code> method which could trigger a page transition by sending an event.</p>
        <img src="images/demostep1.png" alt="Page Step 1" />

        <h4>2. Page State: Plan Selection</h4>
        <p>In this page state, when you click on "Next" button after selecting a plan, it posts the form to the HstComponent's <code>#doAction()</code> method which could trigger a page transition by sending an event.</p>
        <img src="images/demostep2.png" alt="Page Step 2" />

        <h4>3. Page State: Enter Dependents</h4>
        <p>In this page state, when you click on "Next" button after adding more than one dependent's first name and last name, it posts the form to the HstComponent's <code>#doAction()</code> method which could trigger a page transition by sending an event.</p>
        <img src="images/demostep3.png" alt="Page Step 3" />

        <h4>4. Page State: Application Form</h4>
        <p>In this page state, when you click on "Next" button after entering application information, it posts the form to the HstComponent's <code>#doAction()</code> method which could trigger a page transition by sending an event. If you didn't enter any required inputs, then it wouldn't trigger a transition, resulting in staying in the same page.</p>
        <p>When you click on "Cancel" button, the HstComponent will send the "cancel.requested" event, which results in going back to the first page state.</p>
        <img src="images/demostep4.png" alt="Page Step 4" />

        <h4>5. Page State: Review</h4>
        <p>In this page state, when you click on "Next" button after reviewing the inputs, it posts the form to the HstComponent's <code>#doAction()</code> method which could trigger a page transition by sending an event.</p>
        <p>When you click on "Cancel" button, the HstComponent will send the "cancel.requested" event, which results in going back to the first page state.</p>
        <p>The "Next from client-side" button is placed for demonstration purpose. The client-side JavaScript action on the button's click, makes an AJAX call on an <a href="https://xmdocumentation.bloomreach.com/library/concepts/component-development/serve-a-dynamic-resource.html">HST Resource URL</a> to send an event which could trigger a page flow transition, and make a page redirection from the client-side based on the result.</p>

        <h4>6. Page State: Payment Form</h4>
        <p>In this page state, when you click on "Pay Now!" button after entering the inputs, it posts the form to the HstComponent's <code>#doAction()</code> method which could trigger a page transition by sending an event.</p>
        <p>When you click on "Cancel" button, the HstComponent will send the "cancel.requested" event, which results in going back to the first page state.</p>
        <img src="images/demostep6.png" alt="Page Step 6" />

        <h4>7. Page State: Confirmation</h4>
        <p>In this page state, you completed the Page Flow instance!</p>
